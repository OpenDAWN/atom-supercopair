{"name":"Atom-SuperCopair","tagline":"SuperCollider development environment for Atom.io","body":"# SupercoPair\r\n\r\nMerge of two great Atom packages: SuperCollider and AtomPair. You can see more information following the links below:\r\n\r\nSupercollider (0.4.2): https://atom.io/packages/supercollider\r\n\r\nAtomPair (0.1.0): https://atom.io/packages/atom-pair\r\n\r\n## Description\r\n\r\nThis package is intended for cooperative live coding using cloud services. In this case, the sync and interaction is provided by Pusher (http://pusher.com). You will need to start a session with some friends and code together on the same file. Is it possible to evaluate code and stop music in three different ways:\r\n\r\n- Only on your system;\r\n- Only on your friends;\r\n- And on all systems.\r\n\r\nYou can configure a bypass on the settings, and receive an alert before each external evaluation if you don't want to accept all broadcast commands.\r\n\r\n##Starting a new session\r\n\r\n###You\r\n\r\nFirst of all, you need to start a new session.\r\n\r\n> **Your steps:**\r\n\r\n> - Open Atom\r\n> - Create a new “file.sc” or open an existing SuperCollider file.\r\n> - Start a new session:\r\n - Shift-Command-P or Shift-Ctrl-P\r\n - `Supercopair: Start new pairing session`\r\n - Copy the “session ID” and send to your friends\r\n> - Open a post window:\r\n - Shift-Command-K or Shift-Ctrl-K\r\n> - Boot SuperCollider and evaluate:\r\n - `s.boot`\r\n - Shift-Enter\r\n> - Play some sound to test and evaluate:\r\n - `().play`\r\n - Shift-Enter\r\n> - Start coding while your friends join the session..\r\n\r\n\r\n### Your friends\r\n\r\nNow, your friends can join your session. If you are alone in the morning and want to invite a virtual friend, you can also open a separate window using the (Mac OSx) shortcut: Command-Shift-N. Your friends will need the same environment set up to join your session, but they can use any other operational system.\r\n\r\n> **Friends steps:**\r\n\r\n> - Open Atom\r\n> - Copy the “session ID” shared with you\r\n> - Join a pairing session:\r\n - Shift-Command-P of Shift-Ctrl-P\r\n - `Supercopair: Join pairing session`\r\n - Paste the “session ID” and hit Enter\r\n> - Open a post window:\r\n - Shift-Command-K or Shift-Ctrl-K\r\n> - Boot SuperCollider and evaluate:\r\n - `s.boot`\r\n - Shift-Enter\r\n> - Play some sound to test and evaluate:\r\n - `().play`\r\n - Shift-Enter\r\n> - Start a happy and Cooperative Live Coding!\r\n\r\n\r\n## SuperCollider info\r\n\r\nYou can use these shortcuts to interact with SuperCollider local server:\r\n\r\n| key              | command                                              |\r\n| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |\r\n| Shift-Command-K  | Compile library (open window if needed)              |\r\n| Shift-Enter      | Evaluate selection or current line                   |\r\n| Shift-Command-C  | Clear post window                                    |\r\n| Command-.        | Panic ! Stop all music                               |\r\n\r\nYou can use Ctrl instead of Command while using Linux or Windows.\r\n\r\nThe server control window can be opened anytime evaluating this line:\r\n\r\n```\r\nServer.default.makeWindow\r\n```\r\n\r\nTake a look at the original package if you want to lookup classes and use a text-completion.\r\n\r\n\r\n## AtomPair info\r\n\r\nAtomPair uses Pusher cloud service free plan and has some limitations. This service supports up to 20 clients per day. You can exchange 100k messages per day (it includes all messages sent to/from the cloud service), and the sessions may stop after reaching this limit.\r\n\r\nThe free plan allow users to exchange messages only through the US East Coast cloud server.\r\nYou can have other limits on paid plans, although the daily quota is reset only after midnight UTC for all plans. It is important to keep these informations in mind if you face any problem\r\nor high latency. You may want to try some paid plan if you need more clients, messages, or low latency in another country.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Shortcuts to broadcast codes\r\n\r\nStart a new session and use these commands to broadcast codes.\r\n\r\n| key              | command                                              |\r\n| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |\r\n| Shift-Command-Z  | Broadcast an evaluation to everyone on the session   |\r\n| Shift-Command-X  | Broadcast an evaluation exclusively to your pairs    |\r\n| Shift-Command-T  | Broadcast cmd-. to everyone on the session           |\r\n| Shift-Command-Y  | Broadcast cmd-. exclusively to your pairs            |\r\n\r\nYou can use Ctrl instead of Command while using Linux or Windows, and you can also access these commands through the main menu.\r\n\r\n## Support\r\n\r\n[![Gitter](https://badges.gitter.im/Join%20Chat.svg)](https://gitter.im/deusanyjunior/atom-supercopair?utm_source=badge&utm_medium=badge&utm_campaign=pr-badge)\r\n\r\nIssues and pull requests are welcome.\r\n\r\n= )\r\n\r\ndj\r\n","google":"UA-61519135-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
